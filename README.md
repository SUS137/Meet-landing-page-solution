[The challenge]
View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for interactive elements

[My process]

Mobile First.
Use Figma design.
I have divided the content in tree parts, header main and footer.
In the header i need not use nothing  but it is prepare to use flexbox or grid for the desktop layout.
for the main i use Grid, very simple.
To guet the numbers i put two divs, one only for ther right border another for the number.
in the footer i got put the color and the image and use background-blend-mode to get the effect but i am not very happy yet, i would like to get the color more dark... i will try.

Tablet layout (Simple)
Change the titles font size
Change the image in the footer
change the columns in the grid in photos div.

Desktop layout

in my index i puted two ivisible divs that now i am going to need to change the hero section.
Change the titles font size
Change the image in the footer
